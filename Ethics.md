Ethical and Responsible Research Statement

This project uses only public, open-source IoT datasets and processes flow-level metadata only, never packet contents or personally identifiable information.

Data Privacy

All identifiers (IP, MAC, timestamps) were removed before analysis.

Only features necessary for modeling were retained.

No private or sensitive data was collected, stored, or shared.

Fairness and Bias

IoT datasets are often imbalanced; class weighting and balanced evaluation metrics (precision, recall, F1) were used to reduce bias.

Results are reported transparently to avoid misleading conclusions.

Responsible Use

The code and models are strictly for educational and defensive research.
They must not be used to attack IoT devices or create evasion techniques.

Reproducibility

All preprocessing steps, model configurations, and dependencies are documented to ensure transparent and repeatable results.

Deployment Considerations

If applied in real systems, IDS models should follow:

privacy-by-design principles,

secure handling of logs,

clear user communication and consent.
