This repository demonstrates an ethical, transparent, and reproducible data-collection and analysis workflow developed e. It includes two publicly available IoT intrusion-detection datasets collected for research and experimentation.

Overview

This project uses open-source datasets and logs all preprocessing steps, parameters, and metadata to ensure full transparency and reproducibility. All files are version-controlled to support responsible and ethical research practices.
